# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started a golang cobra CLI for icanhazdadjoke

**Thoughts:** I completed the tutorials [Part 1](https://dev.to/divrhino/building-a-command-line-tool-with-go-and-cobra-3mjd) and [Part 2](https://dev.to/divrhino/adding-flags-to-a-command-line-tool-built-with-go-and-cobra-34f1) using cobra and golang to call the icanhazdadjoke REST API. Icanhazdadjoke has a GraphQL API, tomorrow I will converting my app to call the GraphQL implementation

**Link(s) to work**: [DadJoke CLI](https://github.com/cryanbrow/dadjoke)
